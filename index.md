I am a PhD Candidate at the [Programming Language Group](http://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl) at
[Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl). My research focusses on
deriving industry-quality type-checkers from declarative type-system
specifications. I am supervised by [Prof.Dr. Eelco Visser](http://eelcovisser.org).

### Research

I am currently working on improving the performance of the [concurrent _Statix_
solver](https://github.com/metaborg/nabl), by making it automatically incremental.
The goal of this work is to develop a framework for incremental type-checkers that is:
- Language-independent: supports a wide range of name binding patterns.
- Type-checker paradigm independent: not bound to a particular type-checker
  implementation strategy, such as constraint programming.
- Minimizes the effort type-checker writers need to incrementalize their type-checkers.
- Sound and precise

### Teaching

I have been involved in teaching in the following ways:
- Teaching Assistant at the 2021 edition of the _Language Engineering Project_ course.
- Teaching Assistant at the 2021 edition of the _Compiler Construction_ course.

Moreover, I am looking for a master student to collaborate with. Especially, I
want to _bootstrap_ [Statix](http://www.spoofax.dev/references/statix/) (i.e., express
the type system of Statix in Statix itself). That will open up more possibilities
to develop the language further. In particular, adding parametric polymorphism
(generics) will be the second part of this thesis project. I expect this project
to be interesting, varied (involving design, implementation and evaluation) and
certainly doable. For more information, see the
[project description](http://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/master-projects/master/2021/05/15/bootstrapping-and-generics-in-statix/).
